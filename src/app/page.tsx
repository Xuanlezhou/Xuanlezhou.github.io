          I grew up in Singapore and I study Mechanical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

          Iâ€™ve been intrigued by how things work for as long as I can remember.
          From repeatedly taking apart my Uniball Signo 0.38 pens to attempting
          to mesh together a remote controlled aircraft with my brother, I developed
          a passion for working with my hands at a young age. During my years studying
          mechanical engineering at NTU, my desire to know how the world around me
          works only deepened. I progressed from Google Sketch-Up to SolidWorks and
          from Plasticine to 3D-printing. I have learned about different materials,
          manufacturing processes and I want to learn more.
