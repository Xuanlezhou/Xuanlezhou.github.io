      The Shell Eco-marathon is an international competition that challenges
      students to design, build, and drive the most energy-efficient car.
      The primary focus of the event is not on speed, but on maximizing
      fuel efficiency and promoting sustainable and innovative solutions.

      The HYD120GE, inspired by the Diving Falcon and the B2 Spirit Bomber,
      boasts a meticulous design featuring a teardrop shape from both side
      and top views for optimal airflow around the vehicle. Its boat-tail shape,
      chosen for minimal drag, allows for efficient flow energy recovery as back pressure.
