      To encourage the proper usage of toilets in handicapped toilets by members of the public, we introduced a tab at the side of the toilet seat, encouraging male users to lift the toilet seat before using it. We also reduced the thickness in appropriate areas along the circumference, to deter members from stepping on the toilet seat covers.
